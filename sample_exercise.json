    "rawPassage": "Music is an important part of our lives. We connect and interact with it daily and use it as a way of projecting our self-identities to the people around us. The music we enjoy - whether it' s country or classical, rock n' roll or rap - _______ who we are. But where did music, at its core, first come from? It' s a puzzling question that may not have a definitive answer. One _______ researcher, however, has proposed that the key to understanding the origin of music is nestled snugly in the loving bond between mother and child. In a lecture at the University of Melbourne, Richard Parncutt, an Australian-born professor of systematic musicology, endorsed the idea that music originally spawned from ' motherese' -- the playful voices mothers _______ when speaking to infants and toddlers. As the theory goes, increased human brain sizes caused by evolutionary changes occurring between one and 2,000,000 years ago resulted in earlier births, more fragile infants and a _______ need for stronger relationships between mothers and their newborn babies. According to Parncutt, who is based at the University of Graz in Austria, ' motherese' arose as a way to strengthen this maternal bond and to help _______ an infant's survival.",

Half the participants were given advice on how to get more sleep- such as avoiding caffeine before bed, establishing a relaxing _______, and trying not to go to bed too full or hungry. This advice was intended to help them boost the amount of sleep they each got by 90 minutes a night. The remaining 21 volunteers received no such advice. The team found that, of those who were given the advice, 86 per cent spent more time in bed, and around half slept for longer than they used to. These _______ sleep patterns were associated with an average reduction in the intake of free sugars of 10 grams a day. People who were getting more sleep also ate fewer carbohydrates.

The \"Food for healthy life\" website can give you an idea - and if you're under 60 and eat a typical Western diet, the answer could be around a decade or more on average. The website is based on data from hundreds of studies. \"The estimated life _______ is mainly due to a reduction in the risk of heart disease, diabetes and cancer,\" says Lars Fadnes at the University of Bergen in Norway. His team started with recent meta-analyses of the effect of eating various amounts of particular food types, such as fruits. These findings were combined with data on global mortality and what people currently eat to estimate the impact of a permanent change in diet. The highest estimates of lifespan extension are based on a diet designed to _______ the health benefits. This optimized diet involves eating no red or _______ meat, drinking no sugar-sweetened beverages, reducing dairy and egg consumption, and eating more legumes, whole grains and nuts.",

This _______ phenomenon is actually due to a chain of biochemical reactions known as \"enzymatic browning.\" When an apple is injured (or cut into pieces), the plant tissue is exposed to oxygen. This _______ an enzyme known as polyphenol oxidase (PPO) to oxidize polyphenols in the apple's flesh. This results in new chemicals (o-quinones), which then react with amino acids to produce brown-colored melanins. Different apple varieties contain different amounts of both the initial enzyme and the polyphenols, and thus they brown at different rates. Enzymatic browning is not _______ to apples; pears, bananas, and eggplants also turn brown fairly quickly when cut. Enzymatic browning is also responsible for the desirable dark color of prunes, coffee, black tea, and cocoa. Scientists are working to genetically _______ apples that do not produce the PPO enzyme, so perhaps brown apples will someday be a thing of the past.",

    "rawPassage": "You may have heard that you can get water from a cactus if you are ever lost and _______ in a desert. Does it sound like a nice survival tip to store away, but is it really that easy? It turns out that a cactus is not actually a spine-covered basin of fresh water. Such a plant would not last long in an _______ habitat filled with thirsty animals. Water is truly a precious resource in a desert, so, in addition to their _______ spines, most cactus species further protect their spongy flesh with acids and potent alkaloids. These chemicals are usually too acrid for most humans to tolerate and are _______ on the kidneys if ingested. The flesh of some cactus species can also cause vomiting, diarrhea, or temporary paralysis none of which is _______ to your survival in an emergency situation. Cactus fruits are a better bet, though many are also unpalatable if eaten raw.",

While chlorophyll is a harmless chemical, its x _______ in potatoes indicates that the tubers have also increased their production of a glycoalkaloid known as solanine. Solanine protects potatoes and other plants in the family Solanaceae from herbivory and serves to _______ the sprouting spud from hungry animal mouths. Solanine is considered a neurotoxin, and _______ by humans can cause nausea and headaches and can lead to serious neurological problems and even death if enough is consumed. A recent study suggested that a 16-oz (450-gram) fully green potato is enough to make a small adult ill. Cooking does not destroy the solanine toxin, so the green parts of potatoes should be _______ entirely. Green potatoes should especially not be served to children, whose smaller bodies make them more susceptible to poisoning.",

Today, government encourages them to _______ their retirement. We now need to think of retirement as a phased process, where mature age workers _______ reduce their hours, and where they have considerable flexibility in how they combine their work and non-work time. We also need to recognize the broader change that is occurring in how people work, learn, and live. Increasingly we are moving away from a linear relationship between education, training, work, and retirement, as people move in and out of jobs, careers, caregiving, study, and leisure. Employers of choice remove the _______ between the different segments of people's lives, by creating flexible conditions of work and a range of leave entitlements. They take an individualized approach to workforce planning and development so that the needs of employers and employees can be met _______. This approach supports the different transitions that occur across the life course - for example, school to work, becoming a parent, becoming responsible for the care of older relatives, and moving from work to retirement.

Light pollution is a threat for many species that inhabit these locations, particularly those whose ecology or behavior depends, _______, on natural cycles of light and dark. Artificial light is known to have detrimental effects on the ecology of sea turtles, particularly at the hatchling stage when they emerge from nests on natal beaches and head towards the sea. Under natural conditions, turtles hatch predominantly at night (although some early morning and late afternoon emergences occur) and show an innate and well-directed orientation to the water, _______ mostly on light cues that attract them toward the brighter horizon above the sea surface. Artificial lighting on beaches is strongly attractive to hatchlings and can cause them _______ away from the sea and interfere with their ability to orient in a constant direction. Ultimately, this disorientation due to light pollution can lead to death of hatchlings from exhaustion, dehydration and predation.",

The current research investigates the ________ possibility: Can social perceptions influence facial appearance? We examine a social tag that is associated with us early in life— our given name. The hypothesis is that name stereotypes can be manifested in facial appearance, producing a face-name matching effect, ________ both a social perceiver and a computer are able to accurately match a person’s name to his or her face. In 8 studies we demonstrate the existence of this effect, as participants examining an unfamiliar face accurately select the person’s true name from a list of several names, significantly above chance level. We replicate the effect in 2 countries and find that it extends ________ the limits of socioeconomic cues. We also find the effect using a computer-based paradigm and 94,000 faces. In our exploration of the underlying mechanism, we show that existing name stereotypes produce the effect, as its occurrence is culture-dependent. A self-fulfilling ________ seems to be at work, as initial evidence shows that facial appearance regions that are controlled by the individual (e.g., hairstyle) are sufficient to produce the effect, and socially using one’s given name is necessary to generate the effect. Together, these studies suggest that facial appearance represents social expectations of how a person with a specific name should look. In this way a social tag may influence one’s facial appearance.",

They thrive best in households that can provide them with plenty of play and exercise, either with humans or other dogs. Due to their demanding personalities and need for mental ________ and exercise, many Border Collies develop problematic behaviors in households that are not able to provide for their needs. They are infamous for chewing holes in walls and furniture, and ________ scraping and hole digging, due to boredom. Border Collies may exhibit a strong desire to herd, a trait they may show with small children, cats, and other dogs. The breed's herding trait has been deliberately encouraged, as it was in the dogs from which the Border Collie was developed, by selective breeding for many generations. However, being ________ trainable, they can live amicably with other pets if given proper socialization training. The American Border Collie Association recommends that potential owners, before taking on the breed as a household pet, should be sure they can provide regular exercise ________ with the collie's high energy and prodigious stamina. A working collie may run many miles a day, using its experience, personality and intelligence to control challenging livestock. These dogs will become ________ and frustrated if left in isolation, ignored or inactive. Like many working breeds, Border Collies can be motion-sensitive and may chase moving vehicles and bicycles, but this behavior can be modified by training. Some of the more difficult behaviors require patience, as they are developmental and may disappear as the dog matures.",

One thing we do know is that hand ________ is related to brain asymmetry; and it seems to be generally agreed that the human brain is profoundly asymmetric, and that understanding how this works will tell us much about who we are and how our brains work. Brain (function) is ________ into the left and right hemispheres, and this is crucial for understanding language, thought, memory, and perhaps even creativity. For righthanded people, language activity is mainly on the left side. Many left-handers also have left-side language dominance, but a significant number may have language either more ________ distributed in both hemispheres or else predominantly on the right side of the brain.

The sand stores the heat at around 500C, ________ can then warm homes in winter when energy is more expensive. Because of climate change and now thanks to the rapidly rising price of fossil fuels, there's a surge of investment in new renewable energy production. But ________ new solar panels and wind turbines can be quickly added to national grids, these extra sources also present huge challenges. ________, most batteries are made with lithium and are expensive with a large, physical footprint, and can only cope with a limited amount of excess power. One of the big challenges now is whether the technology can be scaled up to really make a difference and will the developers be able to use it to get electricity out ________ heat?

Instead, these snakes have _______ that stick out from the backbone. The spines crack the egg _________ as it passes through the throat. Once the egg is punctured, muscles in the snake’s body work in waves to squeeze out the contents, which then move down into the stomach. The snake then forces the shell back into its mouth by bending its body into an ‘S’ shape. The shell is now drained and flattened into a compact shape. Egg eating snakes sometimes have to go for a long time without any food. So, they eat as many eggs as they can when they get them!",

The growth gap comes from ozone damage, she and her New York colleagues report. Ozone chemists have known that concentrations may spike skyscraper high in city air, but during a full 24 hours, rural trees actually get a higher cumulative ozone exposure from urban pollution that _____ in and lingers. A series of new experiments now shows that this hang-around ozone is the ______ factor in tree growth, the researchers say in the July 10 Nature. \"This study has profound importance in showing us most vividly that rural areas pay the _____ for urban pollution,\" says Stephen R Long of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. \"This work should be a wake-up call,\" he adds.",

The study, which appears in the current issue of Science, was led by Daniel Gilbert, professor of psychology at Harvard and author of the 2007 bestseller “Stumbling on Happiness,” along with Matthew Killingworth and Rebecca Eyre, also of Harvard, and Timothy Wilson of the University of Virginia. “If you want to know how much you will enjoy an experience, you are better off knowing how much someone else enjoyed it than knowing anything about the experience itself,” says Gilbert. “Rather than closing our eyes and _______ the future, we should examine the experience of those who have been there. Previous research in psychology, neuroscience, and behavioral economics has shown that people have difficulty predicting what they will like and how much they will like it, which _____ them to make a wide variety of poor decisions.

The modern system of using personal names developed during World War II, when meteorologists began using women's names — often those of wives or girlfriends — instead of _______ designations based on latitude and longitude. Short and quickly understood, names were easier to _______ over the radio and easier to keep straight if there was more than one storm in a given area. The system was _______ in 1953 when the National Weather Service put together an alphabetical list of female names to be used for storms in the Atlantic basin. Male names were added to the list in 1979 when women's groups pointed out the sexism of using only female names.",

He conducted _______ that found that the high concentration of glutamate in Kombu was what made it so tasty. From there, he crystallized monosodium glutamate (MSG), the seasoning that would become _______ the world over. Decades later Umami became scientifically defined as one of the five individual tastes sensed by receptors on the _______. Then in 1996, a team of University of Miami researchers studying taste perception made another breakthrough. They discovered separate taste receptor cells in the tongue for detecting Umami. Before then, the concept was uncharted. 'Up until our research, the _______ wisdom in the scientific community was that Umami was not a separate sense. It was just a combination of the other four qualities (salty, sweet, bitter, sour)', explained Dr. Stephen Roper, the University of Miami physiology and biophysics professor who helped zero in on the taste along with Nirupa Chaudhari, the team‘s lead researcher.",

The researchers realized that a simpler aircraft designed to stay stable passively would use much less power and reduce manufacturing costs to boot. It turns out that nature _______ them to it. The seeds of trees such as the maple have a single-blade structure that _______ them to fly far away and drift safely to the ground.

A little business that _______ 45% of the cosmetics market in U.S. department stores. A little business that sells in 118 countries and last year grew to be $3.6 billion big in sales. The Lauder family's shares are worth more than $6 billion. But early on, there wasn't a burgeoning business; there weren't houses in New York, Palm Beach, or the south of France. It is said that at one point there was one person to answer the telephones who _______ her voice to become the shipping or billing department as needed. You more or less know the Estee Lauder story because it' s a chapter from the book of American business folklore. In short, Josephine Esther Mentzer, daughter of immigrants, lived above her father's hardware store in Corona, a section of Queens in New York City. She started her _______ by selling skin creams concocted by her uncle, a chemist, in beauty shops, beach clubs and resorts. No doubt the potions were good - Estee Lauder was a quality fanatic - but the sales lady was better. Much better. And she simply outworked everyone else in the cosmetics industry. She _______ the bosses of New York City department stores until she got some counter space at Saks Fifth Avenue in 1948. And once in that space, she utilized a personal selling approach that proved as _______ as the promise of her skin regimens and perfumes.",

This type of pollution is _______ high in coastal regions of tropic and temperate zones, as these are areas of high rates of human population growth and settlement. Light pollution is a threat for many species that inhabit these locations, particularly those whose ecology or behavior depends, _______, on natural cycles of light and dark. Artificial light is known to have detrimental effects on the ecology of sea turtles, particularly at the hatchling stage when they emerge from nests on natal beaches and head towards the sea. Under natural conditions, turtles hatch predominantly at night (although some early morning and late afternoon emergences occur) and show an innate and well-directed orientation to the water, _______ mostly on light cues that attract them toward the brighter horizon above the sea surface. Artificial lighting on beaches is strongly attractive to hatchlings and can cause them _______ away from the sea and interfere with their ability to orient in a constant direction. Ultimately, this disorientation due to light pollution can lead to death of hatchlings from exhaustion, dehydration and predation.",

The promised treats were always visible and the child knew that all she had to do to stop the agonizing wait was ring a bell to call the experimenter back – although in that ________, she wouldn't get the second treat. The longer a child delayed gratification, Mischel found – that is, the longer she was able to wait – the better she would ________ later in life at numerous measures of what we now call executive function. She would ________ better academically, earn more money, and be healthier and happier. She would also be more likely to avoid a number of negative outcomes, including jail time, obesity, and drug use.",
